        "  - Provides end to end research to prod level ML solution , including Model versioning.\n",
        "  - Bundles all the task into a package ranging from\n",
        "    - Reading a data\n",

        "If we do not use the TFX and a separate model independent preprocessing steps, then we really would not be able to rollback, in case preprocessing step changes with the model version updates.\n",

        "### TFX Components :\n",
        "A TFX consists of following components which we will discuss here\n",
        "  - ExampleGen : Read data into TFX pipeline\n",
        "  - StatisticsGen : Calculate exploratory Statistics about the data\n",
        "  - SchemaGen : Create a data schema based on the Statistics\n",
        "  - ExampleValidator: Analyse the data for abnormalities / inconsistencies\n",
        "  - Transform: Perform necessary transformation in the data\n",
        "  - Trainer : Trains the model\n",
        "  - Evaluator : Evaluate the model performance to determine its readiness for deployment/ discard\n",

        "  - Apache Beam :Develop in single node, run in multi-node \n",
        "\n",
        "  We want our ML to run parallely for  greater speed while also being scalable. E.g we would likely develop the Ml model  on a single computer, however when we want it on a prod, we would like to run it on a multi-node cluster environment to serve a lot of parallel requests  with low latency.  Apache  Beam provides this abstraction i.e whatever we research / develop in a single nodeis easily scalable  to multi-node cluster, without any extra work/effort or code modification.\n",
        "  - Apache Airflow / Kubeflow : Deploy, Scale and manage ML application automatically. \n",
        "  \n",
        "  Some example Cases Airflow/ Kubeflow handles\n",
        "    - Define 100 nodes/ input file path / checkpoint path / src code github path / \n",
        "    - Install required libraries in 100 node clusters\n",
        "    - then Deploy ML model to all of them\n",
        "    - Receiving tremendous volume of request for ML model, scale them up..\n",
        "    - Terrible disaster 50 nodes have gone down, we need to bring another 50 uoo to compensate.\n",
        "    - Efficiently utilise CPU/ GPU and minismise cost\n",
        "    - Train your model  cheaply using the AWS spot instance ( i.e use lower cost spot if available )\n",
